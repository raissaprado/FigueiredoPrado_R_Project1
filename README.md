# Welcome to Project 1 for MMED-1056-Web Development 1 by Raissa F. Prado!
In this assignment, hopefully you will find a PERFECT set up with CSS Reset, linking JS and GitHub skills. If it isn't perfect... well, let's pretend that's just me being humble, instead of me having a hard time coding, ok?

# Project description
Each student must demonstrate the ability to properly set up a folder and include the necessary Javascript file and CSS reset. The files must be uploaded to GitHub following the best practices taught in Authoring.
